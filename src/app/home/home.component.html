                        <p> Hello! My name is Krishnanand and I enjoy creating AI models, data pipelines and creaating inferences from data. I started exploring and learning about data engineering and data science when i started working in CTS, from there i learned a lot of data engineering skills and made a passion on solving data related problems. <br><br>
                                
                        Fast-forward to today, i am currently doing my Data-science masters through Work Integrated learning, I have started making and deploying multiple Machine learning models and started gaining new experiances and skills. and Iâ€™ve had the privilege of working at a Service based company, learning from one of the top universities and started making my own projects. My main focus these days are building multile data ingestion and tarnsformation pipelines , script creation which are used for automation, transforming objects in S3 buckets and monitoring jobs , SQL queries based on business understanding for clubbing and making inferences from data for KPI dashboards.<br><br>

                        Here are a few technologies Iâ€™ve been working with recently:<br><br></p>
