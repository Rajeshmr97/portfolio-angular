                        <p> Hello! My name is Brittany and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. My interest in web development started back in 2012 when I decided to try editing custom Tumblr themes â€” turns out hacking together a custom reblog button taught me a lot about HTML & CSS!

                        Fast-forward to today, and Iâ€™ve had the privilege of working at an advertising agency, a start-up, a huge corporation, and a student-led design studio. My main focus these days is building accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences at Upstatement for a variety of clients.

                        I also recently launched a course that covers everything you need to build a web app with the Spotify API using Node & React.

                        Here are a few technologies Iâ€™ve been working with recently:

                        JavaScript (ES6+)
                        TypeScript
                        React
                        Eleventy
                        Node.js
                        WordPress</p>
                </div>
